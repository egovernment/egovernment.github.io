  <h1>Technical documentation of eRegistrations</h1>
  
  **eRegistrations** is an eGovernment system, designed to computerize simple or complex administrative procedures. It can be easily adapted and configured to any administrative process and may apply to procedures such as company registration, construction permits, export licenses or the transfer of a property title.
  
  **eRegistrations** is suited both to operations involving only one public-agency (such as registering at the business registry) and to simultaneous operations at multiple agencies (such as registering a company at the tax office, with the municipal council, with social security, at the labour department and at the business registry). It acts a single electronic window. It can be installed at the municipal, national or supranational levels.
