# The “eRegistrations” concept

The eRegistrations system is a software allowing swift development of eGovernment applications through which users of the public service can request online simultaneous registration with various government agencies with **one single form**, a **single set of documents** and a **single payment**. 

- We use here the word “**registration**” in a wide sense; it refers to any approval or acknowledgement by a public entity of a request or declaration made by a user of the public service. The result of a “registration” is usually a number and/or a document (called certificate, license, permit, authorization, registration, clearance, approval, etc.)

- **eRegistrations** is the name of the software/system on the basis of which specific applications are developed.

- The resulting **applications** can be called “electronic single windows” or, more properly, “online services”. In the latter case, the mentioned “service” is indeed a joint service granted by multiple agencies acting as one.

	<div class="col-md-6">Administrative procedures are always, in essence, an exchange of information (data and documents) between a user and one or various administrations, irrespective of the content of the data and of the documents. Simplifying an administrative process consists in reducing to the minimum the quantity of data, of documents and of payments requested from users and of interactions between the users and the participating agencies. Ideally, the user fills one (short) form, gives one (limited) set of documents and makes only one payment.</div>

		The online services/applications developed on the basis of eRegistrations are composed of the following parts: 
		<ul>
			<li>part A (front office or “file creation”): creation and submission by the user of its application file</li>
			<li>part B (back office or “file processing”)</li>
			<li>user database: storage of user data, content of the application file and registration certificates issued by the participating agencies </li>
			<li>statistics, translation and user rights</li>
		</ul>

		The user database is a central part of all eRegistrations applications and constitutes one of the main differences between those applications and traditional eGovernment applications, that strive to create interoperability between the systems/databases of the participating agencies. On the contrary, the eRegistrations philosophy is to create a user database where users from which the user information will be shared with the government agencies and where the information issued by the government agencies will also be stored. Interoperability among government agencies is obtained via the user database.

eRegistrations applications are developed along the above described standard structure, independently from the number of participating agencies and from the type of registration or certificates they deliver. It doesn’t matter if the online joint service is about company creation, construction permits, business licenses, sanitary registries, import or export operations. 

The purpose of part A of eRegistrations applications is:
<ul>
	<li>to determine, for each user, what registrations are mandatory and/or optional (A1); for the selected registrations (A2), what are the data, documents and payments that must be provided (A3)</li>

	<li>to generate a form and monitor its filling (A4), a list of required documents and monitor their uploading (A5), indicate the total amount to be paid (A6)</li>

	<li>give the user an opportunity to review his request, to certify and send it (A7).</li>
</ul>


Part B (back office) of eRegistrations applications organizes the flow of information between the users database and the participating agencies. It brings the required information to each agency (data, documents and indication of amounts paid) and gets back the data and documents issued by the agencies.  

Another function of Part B (we should maybe call it Part C) is to produces statistics: 
<ul>
	<li>Analysis of the requests: type and numbers of requests, age, gender, nationality, region, activities, etc. any constructive users’ data</li>

	<li>Processing time (per institution, per operator, etc.) – bottlenecks, etc.</li>
</ul>
